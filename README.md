Movie Data Analysis
This README file provides an overview of a data analysis project exploring a movie dataset. It contains information about various movies, including their titles, genres, directors, actors, release years, runtime, ratings, number of votes, and revenue.

The goal of this project is to gain insights into movie trends and audience preferences. Some initial analyses have been conducted to explore the data and identify interesting patterns. For instance, we've investigated the distribution of movie genres, the relationship between revenue and ratings, and the number of movies released per year.

Here are some key findings:
There are a high number of movies in the Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi genres.
A strong correlation exists between revenue, votes, rating, and metascore.
The number of movies released per year has increased over the past decade.

Next steps for this project include:
Analyze the relationship between movie genre and revenue in more detail.
Identify directors with the highest-grossing movies.
Investigate the distribution of movie runtime and its impact on ratings.
This project utilizes Python libraries like pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization.
